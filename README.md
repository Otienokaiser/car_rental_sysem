🌿 Creating and Working on a Feature Branch

We use feature branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.

Step 1: Update your local main branch

Make sure your local main branch is up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
````
Step 2: Create a new feature branch

Feature branch names should be descriptive. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login-system
````

This creates and switches you to a new branch called feature/login-system.

Step 3: Work on your feature

Make changes to files as needed.

💾 Saving Your Work
Step 1: Check which files have changed

```bash
git status
````
Step 2: Stage your changes (prepare them to be saved)

```bash
git add .
````

This stages all your changes.

Step 3: Commit your changes with a message

```bash
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"
````

Write clear commit messages explaining what you did.

📤 Uploading Your Changes to GitHub

Push your feature branch so others can see it:

```bash
git push origin feature/login-system
````

🛑 Important Collaboration Rules

. Do NOT commit or push directly to the main branch.
. Always create a feature branch for your work.
. Keep feature branches focused on one task.
. Use clear commit messages.
. Wait for code review before merging your PR.

🧹 Keeping Your Branch Updated

If main changes while you’re working:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

git checkout feature/login-system
git merge main
````

Fix any conflicts, then push your updated feature branch:

```bash
git push origin feature/login-system
````
